Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test site https://reqres.in.

Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server https://reqres.in. 

10 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 1.333 And Total Concurrent API requested: 80.

50 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 6.667 And Total Concurrent API requested: 400.

100 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 13.3 And Total Concurrent API requested: 800.

While executed 100 concurrent request, found  1 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.13%.

Summary: Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 80 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
